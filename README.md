💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

I recently completed a project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. Due to the highly imbalanced dataset (~0.17% fraud cases), I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for class balancing and developed two robust models.

⚙️ Tech Stack & Methods Used:
🔹 Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
🔹 Logistic Regression with Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
🔹 Random Forest Classifier (n_estimators=30, max_depth=30)
🔹 PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson) for skewed features
🔹 RobustScaler for normalizing 'Amount'
🔹 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, ROC-AUC
🔹 Model Interpretability: Partial Dependence Plots

📊 Key Achievements:
✅ Logistic Regression achieved ~98% Accuracy
✅ Random Forest achieved ~99% Accuracy and excellent ROC-AUC
✅ SMOTE significantly improved fraud detection sensitivity
✅ Generated insightful visualizations to understand class distribution and feature impact

🔍 This project helped me gain deeper insights into:

Working with imbalanced datasets

Designing interpretable and scalable ML pipelines

Optimizing models for real-world anomaly detection tasks
